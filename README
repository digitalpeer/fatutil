fatutil is used to manipulate FAT filesystem images without mounting them or
having unecessary system dependencies (privileged access).  This is useful
for scripting the creation or modification of FAT filesystem images.  For
example, files can be added, directories can be created, and contents can be
listed within the FAT filesystem image without ever mounting it.

To build use:
autoreconf --install
./configure
make

Run fatutil with no options to get the help:

usage: fatutil FATIMG CMD [OPTIONS]
Where CMD [OPTIONS] is one of the following:
  stat
  ls DIR
  rmdir DIR
  unlink FILE
  mkdir DIR
  write SOURCE_FILE FAT_DEST_FILE
  read FAT_SOURCE_FILE DEST_FILE

The FATIMG (filesystem image) must be created and fatutil does not cover
doing that. genfat.sh is included as an example of how to do this and looks
something like this:

dd if=/dev/zero of=fatfs.img bs=1M count=100
mkfs.vfat fatfs.img
