To build use ./configure and then make. 

fatutil is used to manipulate FAT filesystem images without mounting them or having
unecessary system dependencies.  This is useful for scripting the creation or 
modification of FAT filesystem images.  For example, files can be added, directories
can be created, and contents can be listed within the FAT filesystem image.

usage: fatutil FATIMG CMD [OPTIONS]
Where CMD [OPTIONS] is one of the following:
  stat
  ls DIR
  rmdir DIR
  unlink FILE
  mkdir DIR
  write SOURCE_FILE FAT_DEST_FILE
  read FAT_SOURCE_FILE DEST_FILE

The FATIMG (filesystem image) must be created and fatutil does not cover doing that.
genfat.sh is included as an example of how to do this and looks something
like this:

dd if=/dev/zero of=fatfs.img bs=1M count=100
mkfs.vfat fatfs.img
